					<li><strong>About the www.booking.com</strong>
						<ul>
							<li>Welcome to www.booking.com (the ‘<strong>Platform’</strong>). The Platform is a marketplace for booked suppliers and venues who have registered (via the Sign-Up page) on the Platform (‘Suppliers/Venues’) to quote on Jobs posted by booked couples who have registered (via the Sign-Up page) on the Platform (‘Couples’) and for Couples to book and pay for the Quotes they select (the ‘<strong>Services</strong>‘).</li>
							<li>The Platform is operated by booking Pty Ltd (ABN 51 619 754 139). Access to and use of the Platform, or any of its associated Services, is provided by booking. Please read these terms and conditions (the ‘<strong>Terms and Conditions</strong>‘) carefully. By using, browsing and/or reading the Platform, this signifies that you have read, understood and agree to be bound by the Terms and Conditions. If you do not agree with the Terms and Conditions, you must cease usage of the Platform, or any of Services, immediately.</li>
							<li>booking reserves the right to review and change any of the Terms and Conditions by updating this page at its sole discretion. When booking updates the Terms and Conditions, it will use reasonable endeavours to provide you with notice of updates to the Terms and Conditions. Any changes to the Terms and Conditions take immediate effect from the date of their publication. Before you continue, we recommend you keep a copy of the Terms and Conditions for your records.</li>
						</ul>

				<ol start="2">
					<li><strong>Acceptance of the Terms</strong></li>
				</ol>
				<p>You accept the Terms and Conditions by remaining on the Platform. You may also accept the Terms and Conditions by clicking Sign-Up or Login to accept or agree to the Terms and Conditions where this option is made available to you by booking in the user interface.</p>

					<li><strong>Scope of booking Services</strong>
						<ul>
							<li>booking provides the Platform only to enable Couples to post Jobs that they need for their booked or booked events. Jobs are viewable by all Suppliers/Venues of the Platform.</li>
							<li>Suppliers/Venues may Quote in response to a Job. These Quotes are only viewable by the Couple who posted the Job.</li>
							<li>The Couple may revoke or modify a Job at any time before the Couple accepts a Quote by using the built in Private Messaging System. The Supplier/Venue also has the chance to modify the Quote at the Couples’ request or revoke their Quote at any time prior to the Couple accepting the Quote.</li>
							<li>Once the Couple accepts the Quote in accordance with clause 3.3. The Supplier/Venue must confirm their availability and the cost via an Invoice, incorporating any modifications in accordance with clause 3.3. Where the Supplier/Venue is not available for the Job they must revoke their Quote prior to sending the Invoice.</li>
							<li>booking reserves the right to cancel or remove any Job made prior to the modification permitted in clause 3.3.</li>
							<li>Once a Quote is accepted by the Couple, and the availability confirmed by the Supplier/Venue via the Invoice; the Contract is created. When this occurs, the Couple must pay the amount nominated on the Invoice on the Platform using the Checkout, powered by Assembly.</li>
							<li>Upon creation of the Contract, booking has rendered its Services and the booking Fees are also due and payable. For the avoidance of doubt, this occurs at the time in which the Invoice is paid and the booking Fees are deducted from the Supplier/Venue.</li>
							<li>Once the Contract is created, the Couple and Supplier/Venue may vary the Invoice and/or Contract on the Platform only. The Couple and Supplier/Venue are encouraged to use the booking Private Messaging System to communicate any amendments.</li>
							<li>The Supplier/Venue must perform the Job required under the Contract, unless otherwise agreed between the Couple and Supplier/Venue.</li>
							<li>After the Contract is completed, the Couple is encouraged to provide a rating and review of the Supplier/Venue’s fulfillment of the Job. In addition, booking encourages Couples and Suppliers/Venues to provide feedback to booking on the booking Services provided. Such feedback can be provided on the Contact Us page on the Platform.</li>
							<li>booking will in some circumstances enable Couples to request a Quote for their Job from a particular Supplier/Venue. When this occurs, the Supplier/Venue will be automatically notified of the new Job and that the Couple would like the Supplier/Venue to provide a Quote if they are available to provide the booked Services required under the Job.</li>
